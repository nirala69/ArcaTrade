# ArcaTrade


The purpose of this project is to build a “player auction management system”, a place for players and owners to come together and trade players. So, we are making an Auction management system for any game.

Our Institute’s gaming club(Arcadia) use to host auctions for CSGO events where player registers and owners get registered and then owners were given points and then they bid for the players that are displayed, so we took inspiration from the auctions and tried to make a management system for the smooth functioning of the Auctions. 


Users can enter as a player or as an owner. Once all this is done, one can start the auction, and players are shown one by one for bidding and simultaneously the points table is present. Once the auction ends final points table is printed.
